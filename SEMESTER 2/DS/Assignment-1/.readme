Assignment: 
a. Implement a circular linked list as an ADT with the operations discussed in the lectures.
b. Use the ADT in part (a) to Implement Stack as an ADT with the operations discussed in the lectures.
b.  Use the ADT in part (b) to convert an in-fix expression into a post-fix expression.
c. Use the ADT in part (b)  and the postfix expression obtained in part (c) to evaluate the expression.


The input should be most general with operations +, -, *, / and ^
